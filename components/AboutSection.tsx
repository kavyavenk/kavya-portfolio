              Bridging Technology and Social Impact Through

            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
              I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Computer
              Science at Columbia University specializing in
              Machine Learning, building upon my strong
              foundation from Georgia Institute of Technology
              where I graduated with a 3.91 GPA and Highest
              Honors. My journey spans from software engineering
              to cutting-edge AI and data science applications.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
              At Ernst & Young, I worked as an AI & Data
              Technology Consulting Intern, developing data
              modernization solutions building advanced agentic
              workflows, and using microservices architecture,
              Databricks, and modern cloud technologies. My
              experience ranges from creating AI-driven
              forecasting tools to implementing workforce
              planning chatbots that enhance operational
              efficiency.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
              What drives me most is the intersection of
              technology and social good. My undergraduate
              research on technology-enabled coercive control in
              intimate partner violence has been presented at
              multiple conferences, combining technical
              expertise with deep social awareness. When I'm not
              coding, you'll find me humming music across
              genres, curled up with a good book, catching the
              latest F1 race or tennis match, or exploring art
              museums and galleries â€“ pursuits that fuel my
              creativity in technical problem-solving.
